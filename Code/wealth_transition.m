function [ transition_matrix ] = wealth_transition(c_function, d_function, m_grid, R, wealth_grid, lambda)
%iterate_wealth_distribution iterates the distribution of wealth forward
%one period given consumption and borrowing funtions.
% Inputs:
%    c_function - consuption function
%    d_funcion - debt function
%    m_grid - cash-on-hand grid relating to the points of c_function and
%    d_function
%    R - risk free interest rate
%    wealth_grid - discretized grid of wealth
%    lambda - recovery rate on default
% Outputs:
%    transition_matrix - iterates a distribution for wealth defined on
%    wealth_grid forward one unit of time, assuming agents follow the input
%    policy functions
