%wealth_transition_global_shock creates the transition matrix to iterate the distribution of wealth forward
%one period given consumption and borrowing funtions AND given a global
%shock to prices with debt and savings set in nominal terms
% Inputs:
%    c_function - consuption function
%    d_funcion - debt function
%    m_grid - cash-on-hand grid relating to the points of c_function and
%    d_function
%    R - risk free interest rate
%    wealth_grid - discretized grid of wealth
%    lambda - recovery rate on default
%    price_shock - Multiplicative factor for prices (1.1 => 10% increase in
%    prices)
%    bankrupcy_costs_fraction_eq - equilibrium costs of bankrutcy
% Outputs:
%    transition_matrix_global_shock - iterates a distribution for wealth defined on
%    wealth_grid forward one unit of time, given the price_shock
%    wealth_loss - the amount of income lost to default at each point on
%    wealth_grid
